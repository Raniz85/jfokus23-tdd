        Correct! Eve Stermball won with a total score of 790. Impressive!
    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfied with your work you quickly return to your other duties.
        After a few minutes, you get a call from your manager requiring your help.
        Apparently your CEO is furious because he didn't win.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discussing with your manager you decide to alter the rules a bit for the next bowling series:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>If all ten pins are downed on the first roll it is deemed a strike and grants 10 points</li>
        <li>If all ten pins are downed by the second roll it is deemed a spare and grants 5 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With these new rules, let's return to the example and calculate new scores:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yatas Del Lana 3 5 3 5 7 2 3 0 10 4 3
Eve Stojbs 3 7 3 3 9 1 6 4 2 3 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Dividing this up in frames we get:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yatas Del Lana | 3 5 | 3 5 | 7 2 | 3 0 | 10  | 4 3
Eve Stojbs      | 3 7 | 3 3 | 9 1 | 6 4 | 2 3 | 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Summing up the scores according to the new rules you arrive at:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>Yatas Delana: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 10 (1 strike) = 55
        <li>Eve Stojbs: 3 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 1 +  6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 3 &times; 5 (3 spares) = 57
    </ul>
    <p>
        And according to these rules Eve Stojbs is the winner with 57 points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfied with the rule changes you go back to your other duties.
        It doesn't take long for the next scorecard to arrive though
        - apparently your CEO called up everyone else and strongarmed them into another round of bowling as soon as he got
        your rule changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just to be safe, you decide to keep the original scoring implementation in case he decides to revert to the
        original rules and add the new rules as an alternate scoring mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the scores in the new <a href="series02.txt" target="_new">series</a>,
        calculate the winner and their score according to the revised rules.
