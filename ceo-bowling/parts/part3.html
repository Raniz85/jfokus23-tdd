        Correct!
        Unfortunately,
        this means that your CEO didn't win this time either,
        but Zerkk MacBurger won with a total score of 1053, very impressive!

        Anticipating a call from your manager,
        you find it hard to get started on anything else.
        Instead, in preparation for the next rule change you look through your CEO's series and plot the histogram of his
        rolls.

    <p>
        Looking at the data, it seems that your CEO bowls by throwing the heaviest ball he can find as hard as possible.
        A strategy that seems to produce a lot of misses, but also a fair number of strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your manager comes over (no call this time) you quickly explain the situation and you both sit down to
        discuss potential rule changes that will favour this bowling style.
        Deciding that you need to <i>really</i> reward strikes and spares you decide on the following additions to the rules:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>For each strike made the bonus score of a strike increases by 2</li>
        <li>For each spare made the bonus score of a spare increases by 1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With these new rules, let's return to the example and calculate new scores:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yatas Del Lana | 3 5 | 3 5 | 7 2 | 3 0 | 10  | 4 3
Eve Stojbs      | 3 7 | 3 3 | 9 1 | 6 4 | 2 3 | 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Summing up the scores according to the new rules you arrive at:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>Yatas Delana: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 10 (1 strike) = 55
        <li>Eve Stojbs: 3 + 7 + + 3 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 + (5 + 6 + 7) (3 spares) = 60
    </ul>
    <p>
        And according to these rules Eve Stojbs is again the winner, but with 60 points this time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time, surely he must win.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        Given the scores in the new <a href="series03.txt" target="_new">series</a>,
        calculate the winner and their score.
