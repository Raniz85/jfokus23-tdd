        Sigh. Zoe Bjeffs takes the game with 1046 points.
        Impressive, but your strategy seems to have failed this time too.
        It seems impossible to make your CEO win.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thinking about how your CEO bowls, maybe something that rewards consecutive strikes
        could be a good idea. You think for a while and come up with these rule changes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>Each strike rewards the next two rolls as bonus points.</li>
        <li>Each spare rewards the next roll as bonus points.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        They feel familiar somehow, but you quickly dismiss that thought and move on to the example:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yatas Del Lana | 3 5 | 3 5 | 7 2 | 3 0 | 10  | 4 3
Eve Stojbs      | 3 7 | 3 3 | 9 1 | 6 4 | 2 3 | 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Summing up the scores according to these new rules you arrive at:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>Yatas Delana: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 10 + (4 + 3) (Strike) + 4 + 3 = 52
        <li>Eve Stojbs: 3 + 7 + 3 (Spare) + 3 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 6 (Spare) + 6 + 4 + 2 (Spare) + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 53
    </ul>
    <p>
        And according to these rules Eve Stojbs wins with 53 points.
    </p>
    <p>
        You send your email with the proposed rule changes and hope for the best.

        Given the scores in the new <a href="series04.txt" target="_new">series</a>,
        calculate the winner and their score.
