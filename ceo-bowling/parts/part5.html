        Not entirely unexpected, the winner was someone else: Kim Octo with 893 points.
        It really seems like you can't come up with any decent rules that gives your CEO an advantage.

        You open up your browser to check your email,
        but you seem to have been logged out.
        You enter your password but it is not accepted.
        Disregarding that you go back to work,
        but you can't access the company's source code repositories either.
    </p>
    <p>
        You call up your manager, asking what's up.
        After putting you on hold for a while they tell you that they're coming over.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a while you see your manager approaching - and they don't look too happy.
        You quickly realise what's up and start gathering your things,
        your manager confirms that you have indeed been fired because of your failure to
        make your CEO win over the other CEOs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, that's that.
        It's not like you had time to settle in or anything
        - you've only been here for 4 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        On your way home you walk past a bowling alley.
        As you walk past someone in an ill-fitting suit is escorted out by two others
        in decidedly sharper suits.
    </p>
    <p>
        You quickly realise that the guy in the crumpled suit is your former CEO.
        He catches you looking at him and shouts at you, asking quite rudely who you are and what you're staring at.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of coming up with something smart you mumble something about calculating scores for their bowling games.
        Your former CEO stares at you for a while and then silently leaves, it seems he's about as bad at confrontations
        as you are.
    </p>
    <p>
        As he walks away one of the other CEOs comes up to you.
        She introduces herself as Page Lyrar - the CEO of Vilta Asta, the search company.
        She explains that all the other CEOs grew tired of your former CEO's constant attempts to alter the rules in his
        favour and decided to throw him out when he tried to reward 500 "consolidation points" to whoever made the most
        misses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking at you,
        she thinks for a bit and then tells you that she has uses for a talented programmer and asks if you'd be
        interested in doing a work test here and now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taken by surprise, you quickly recover and accept.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to calculate the scores of the latest round,
        but since no one can decide on which rules to use anymore they've decided to use all of them.
        A bowler's final score is quite simply the sum of their scores under all the different rules you've implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the scores in all the previous series, calculate the overall winner and their final score.
