        <em>Beep, beep, beep, ..., BEEP.</em> It seems the system is restarting.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the system has successfully booted up again you're greeted with the regular status screen. You notice
        two notifications and quickly read them through:
    </p>
    <div class="flight-console bg-blue text-base3 mx-auto">
        <line> </line>
        <line>- System Successfully Rebooted!</line>
        <line> </line>
        <line>- Memory Corruption Error.</line>
        <line>  The following data failed to restore:</line>
        <line>   - Time</line>
        <line>   - Flight route</line>
        <line>   - TubMaster 58K user presets</line>
    </div>
    <p>
        Meh, it seems you'll have to fix a few more things manually. You quickly input the current stardate (78277.66)
        which is conveniently available on your PDA and then think about the flight route.
    </p>
    <p>
        You know that the route consisted of point to point legs from star system to star system, with the next stop
        being whichever unvisited star system is the closest and returning back to Sol once all systems has been visited.
    </p>
    <p>
        You download <a href="map.txt">the map of star systems</a> from the autopilot and take a look. The map seems to
        be a list of all star systems to visit and their relative position to Sol in normalized movemental galactic
        coordinates. Neat, those work just like a Euclidean 4-space so this shouldn't be hard to calculate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just to be sure you're on top of your Euclidian n-space mathematics you bring up the section about
        Euclidean distance on your PDA:
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
        <h1>Euclidean Distance</h1>
        <p>
            Distance in a Euclidean n-space is calculated by recursively applying the Pythagorean theorem to the
            coordinate pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting in two dimensions, the distance between the coordinate pairs <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> is:
            <img src="euclid-distance-n2.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Adding another dimension means using the distance in the first two dimensions as one of the sides in the
            Pythagorean theorem and the distance in the third dimension as the second side:
            <img src="euclid-distance-n3.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Which simplifies to:
            <img src="euclid-distance-n3-simplified.svg" />
        </p>
        <p>
            After this, it is rather easy to see that the general formula for distance in Euclid n-space is:
            <img src="euclid-distance-n.svg" />
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Calculate the route and use the ordered list of systems as the seed for the Marvin TPA reduction algorithm.
        Don't forget that the trip starts and ends at Sol (which has coordinates <span class="inline-code">0, 0, 0, 0</span>).
